# Assignment



The Scripts folder contains the python program, saurabh.py, to download the json file from the given link and to convert it into csv file.

The converted csv file, output.csv, is stored in the Data folder.

The json file from the link has few records as having attribute 'id' and few records as having attribute '_id'. This was creating a problem in making the csv file, so I have ignored this attribute as whole and have created the csv file with the other attributes for the records.

Time taken for me to complete this task was 20 minutes.
